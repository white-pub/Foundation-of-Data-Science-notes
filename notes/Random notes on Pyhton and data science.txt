Yes, you can use NumPy functions like np.radians() on a Pandas DataFrame or Series. Pandas is built on top of NumPy, so its DataFrame and Series objects are compatible with NumPy functions.

Yes, Cartesian coordinates (x, y, z) can be considered ratio data. Ratio data is a type of quantitative data that has a meaningful zero point and allows for both differences and ratios to be calculated. In the case of Cartesian coordinates:

- Zero Point: The origin (0, 0, 0) serves as a meaningful zero point.
- Differences: You can calculate the distance between any two points.
- Ratios: You can compare distances and say, for example, that one distance is twice as long as another.

This makes Cartesian coordinates suitable for various mathematical and analytical operations that require ratio data properties²⁵.

    Standardize the Data
Before performing KNN imputation, we will . Standardization is important because KNN uses distance metrics, which can be skewed if the scales of different features are very different.
